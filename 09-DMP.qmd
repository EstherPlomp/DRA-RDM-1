# Plan for RDM {#plan}

We will use the lessons learned to plan for Data Management via the Data Management Plan. At the end of this module you should be able to:

-   Recognise the relevance of planning research data management
-   Get familiar with the concept of Data Management Plans and their format
-   Recognise the value of creating a Data Management Plan

## What is a Data Management Plan (DMP)?

What exactly is a data management plan? Watch the [video for an introduction to data management plans](https://youtu.be/28rTTRFDq58). (Script adapted from [@holmstrand2019]).

## Why create a Data Management Plan?

Why is it necessary to create a data management plan?

-   Planning in advance will save time later

-   Especially when working with confidential and sensitive data, it is important to manage the data according to requirements and best practices.

-   You can use the Data Management Plan as an agreement between multiple partners (yourself and your supervisor, or your research group and other research groups) on how to manage data.

-   You can use the DMP as a starting point for a common vocabulary for managing data when you work with multiple disciplines!

## What needs to be in a Data Management Plan?

A Data Management Plan should provide [information on six main topics](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-dmp.html).

## [RDMO](https://rdmo.mpdl.mpg.de/) (Research Data Management Organiser)

-   You can use it to write DMPs, organise data management for a project

-   collaborate with other users (also external)

-   Versioning

-   Export and import functions
