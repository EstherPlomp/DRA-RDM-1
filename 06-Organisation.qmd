# Realising FAIR: Data organisation

## Data Organisation

Good data organisation will allow you to make the data Findable both for yourself and for your collaborators who have access to the data. Implementing a good folder structure, data organisation and a meaningful file naming convention is a simple first step towards making data FAIR.

-   **It is easier to do data organisation right from the start, which will save you a lot of time!**

-   **There is no one right way to do it, and you may have to adapt to workflows in your lab/team**

In the next video, we will go through some best practices to help you organise the data of your project efficiently. These best practices are using a good folder structure, tagging files (if possible) and an appropriate file naming convention to enhance the findability of the data in your directories.
