# Realising FAIR: Data organisation

## Data Organisation

Good data organisation will allow you to make the data Findable both for yourself and for your collaborators who have access to the data. Implementing a good folder structure, data organisation and a meaningful file naming convention is a simple first step towards making data FAIR.

-   **It is easier to do data organisation right from the start**, which will save you a lot of time!

-   **There is no one right way to do it,** and you may have to adapt to workflows in your lab/team

To organise your files it is good to set up a folder structure and choose a file naming convention. [Best practices for file naming for MDPL researchers are summarised on the RDM website](https://rdm.mpdl.mpg.de/before-research/file-handling/).

## Hierarchical folder structure 

List the types of data in your project and fit them into categories. These can be by file type, time period, collection method, project, or instrument

-   Avoid overlapping categories/names

-   Choose meaningful names

-   Avoid going to deep in the hierarchy (too many subfolders)

-   Don't let the list of files in a folder grow too big - add a new subfolder

-   Consider who needs access to what if you have collaborators

## Research Compendium

A [research compendium](https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.3192v2) combines all elements of your project, allowing others to reproduce your work. This works particularly well when you work with data and code and have to share these with others.

## Tagging files

You can also tag files to organise them (see this [MIT guide](https://libguides.mit.edu/metadataTools)): Tagging files

-   Add short keywords to files (files can have more than 1 tag)

-   Tagging can be used in combination with the hierarchical folder structure

-   Consistency is key (for example, report, Report and reports are three seperate tags instead of one!)

-   Tagging might depend on the software you're using

## File naming convention

File names can add information to the file to make them more findable and understandable
