# Realising FAIR: Data organisation

## Data Organisation

Good data organisation will allow you to make the data Findable both for yourself and for your collaborators who have access to the data. Implementing a good folder structure, data organisation and a meaningful file naming convention is a simple first step towards making data FAIR.

-   **It is easier to do data organisation right from the start, which will save you a lot of time!**

-   **There is no one right way to do it, and you may have to adapt to workflows in your lab/team**

To organise your files it is good to set up a folder structure and choose a file naming convention.

## Hierarchical folder structure 

List the types of data in your project and fit them into categories. These can be by file type, time period, collection method, project, or instrument

-   Avoid overlapping categories/names

-   Choose meaningful names

-   Avoid going to deep in the hierarchy (too many subfolders)

-   Don't let the list of files in a folder grow too big - add a new subfolder
