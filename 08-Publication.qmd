# Realising FAIR: Data Publication

In this module, we will discover the FAIR data principles and their main elements as they relate to data publication:

-   Identify relevant tools to advance towards FAIR data
-   Discuss data publication, best practices and restrictions

## Data Repository

One way to make the data of your project Findable and Accessible to a broad audience is to publish it in a **data repository**. Data repositories help you comply with the FAIR principles and make it easy to apply some of their main elements, such as **licences** and **persistent identifiers**. You share data for the long-term in a data repository: generally these are finalised datasets or scripts.

-   Always discuss with your supervisor/collaborators what data/code to share on data repositories!

-   See The Turing Way on how to [select an appropriate data repository](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-repository#selecting-an-appropriate-repository)

## Selecting what data and code to preserve

Preserve data and code that are:

-   Needed to **verify findings** you have published in a paper (see also journal/university requirements)

-   **Important** (taking into account the quality, originality, size, scale and innovative nature of the research)

-   **Unique** (based on non-repeatable observations)

-   You may need to **way up the costs** between collecting the data again versus making the data FAIR and storing it

## Search for a disciplinary specific data repository

If you would like to look for a disciplinary specific data repository, you can use:

-   [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/)
-   [fairsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/)
-   [NIH list of discipline specific data repositories](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/NIHbmic/domain_specific_repositories.html)
-   [Springer Nature: Recommended Data Repositories](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/research-data-policy/recommended-repositories)
-   [Google Dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
-   Data availability statements in publications

Data repositories will facilitate sustainable access to your data. For more information, watch this short video on '[Sustainability of data use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhI1SF_r_K8)' (from the Open Data Governance and Use - released under the CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license)

## Data/Software Articles

You can also share your data and code via a **data or software article**.

-   The Turing Way hosts a [List of data journals](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-article), with the following ecology journals:
    -   [Ecological Research](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/14401703/homepage/forauthors)
    -   [Global Ecology and Biogeography](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/14668238/homepage/forauthors.html)
-   [In which journal should I publish my software?](https://www.software.ac.uk/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software)
    -   for example: the [Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://joss.theoj.org/)

## Software Sharing

Just sharing software via platforms like GitHub is not sufficient to adhere to the FAIR principles. GitHub/GitLab does not assign a persistent identifier/DOI to the software, and GitHub/GitLab does not have a long term preservation policy like data repositories do. You can share your software on GitHub/GitLab and share a snapshot/version of the code in a data repository as well.

-   See [here for more information between the GitHub/Zenodo integration](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content)

Checkout [papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/) to see how other researchers have shared their code!

## Why not the supplemental materials?

-   **Data control**: supplementary materials are managed by the publisher and cannot be updated, unlike most data repositories that use versioning
-   **Interoperability**: supplementary materials do not always allow the original format, which makes it difficult to integrate and interact with the data
-   **Availability**: It is difficult to access if the article is behind the paywall (supplemental materials are not included in the DOI and therefore the links can also break!)
-   **Impact**: Data should be a primary research output!
-   **Publisher requirements**: Some publishers recommend using a data repository instead
-   **Not FAIR**: Data/Software available in supplemental materials is not considered to be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Resuable)
