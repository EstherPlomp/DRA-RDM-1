# Realising FAIR: Data Publication

## Data access

It is important to reflect about data access at the beginning of your project to ensure that the right people have access to the right data.

One way to make the data of your project Findable and Accessible to a broad audience is to publish it in a **data repository**. Data repositories help you comply with the FAIR principles and make it easy to apply some of their main elements, such as **licences** and **persistent identifiers**.

[![The Turing Way project illustration by Scriberia. Used under a CC-BY 4.0 licence. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3332807.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/main/book/website/figures/DOI.jpg){width="50%"}](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3332807)

In the next video we will delve into data access during and after a research project. You will also be introduced to the topic of data publication and data repositories.

If you would like to look for a disciplinary specific data repository, you can use:

-   [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/)
-   [fairsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/)

Data repositories will facilitate sustainable access to your data. For more information, watch this short video on '[Sustainability of data use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhI1SF_r_K8)' (from the Open Data Governance and Use - released under the CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license)

## Data/Software Articles

You can also share your data and code via a **data or software article**.

-   The Turing Way hosts a [List of data journals](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-article), with the following ecology journals:
    -   [Ecological Research](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/14401703/homepage/forauthors)
    -   [Global Ecology and Biogeography](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/14668238/homepage/forauthors.html)
-   [In which journal should I publish my software?](https://www.software.ac.uk/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software)
    -   for example: the [Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://joss.theoj.org/)

## Software Sharing

Just sharing software via platforms like GitHub is not sufficient to adhere to the FAIR principles. GitHub/GitLab does not assign a persistent identifier/DOI to the software, and GitHub/GitLab does not have a long term preservation policy like data repositories do. You can share your software on GitHub/GitLab and share a snapshot/version of the code in a data repository as well.

-   See [here for more information between the GitHub/Zenodo integration](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content)

Checkout [papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/) to see how other researchers have shared their code!

## Why not the supplemental materials?

-   **Data control**: supplementary materials are managed by the publisher and cannot be updated, unlike most data repositories that use versioning
-   **Interoperability**: supplementary materials do not always allow the original format, which makes it difficult to integrate and interact with the data
-   **Availability**: It is difficult to access if the article is behind the paywall (supplemental materials are not included in the DOI and therefore the links can also break!)
-   **Impact**: Data should be a primary research output!
-   **Publisher requirements**: Some publishers recommend using a data repository instead
-   **Not FAIR**: Data/Software available in supplemental materials is not considered to be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Resuable)
