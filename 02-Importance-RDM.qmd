## Why care about RDM?

Why should you be aware of your Research Data Management?

-   [01-1_Module-1_Video_Presentation_Why RDM is relevant for you](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eJ8R7DbiPRq2ynaImHGzdz8QBgwVt82o/view) (*8 minutes*)

Reflect about what you heard on the video and bring your thoughts and your horror stories to our session.

You can also:

-   [read up on this biology/ecology data horror story](https://www.the-scientist.com/notebook/inside-the-project-trying-to-save-datasets-from-extinction-70690)!

-   listen to the [Data Horror Song](https://twitter.com/rafamoral/status/1571622591219236864) or the [Zheng Lab - Bad Project video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl4L4M8m4d0) for some inspiration!

## Selfish reasons to work reproducibly

Read : [@markowetz2015] Five selfish reasons to work reproducibly **OR** [Watch the presentation](https://youtu.be/1Y_oIjlH-yg?t=355) (*50 min*)

# Why care about documentation?

It is important to document your data so that it remains understandable/usable for yourself and also for others. Terminology, methods and steps that you take in an analysis may be obvious to you, but not for your team members/supervisor.

Watch the [Exact Instructions Challenge video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN2RM-CHkuI) (*7 min*) to see what happens when your documentation is insufficient!
